# juego
yet another JS/Canvas game engine because why not

kind of intending this to be noob-friendly and let people pick it apart easily to
de-mystify the mechanics of game rendering

## HOW TO USE

juego.js is everything

you could make an HTML with script tags that references juego.js and then stick your own code after it

personally i just like to open about:blank in chrome, open the console, and copy/paste the contents of juego.js
